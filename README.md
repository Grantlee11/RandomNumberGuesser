# RandomNumberGuesser
 This is a random number guesser I developed in Python, it presents the user with three seperate options for playing. 
 Option 1 allows the user to keep guessing by themselves. 
 Option 2 allows the user to watch the CPU make guesses. 
 Option 3 allows the User and CPU to race to guess the correct number first.

 The code runs well for the most part, but there is some breakdown with the algorithm in option 3 that'll I'll fix at a future date. I'd like to speed up the CPU guessing, by making it account for the User's most recent guess, and I'd like to stop the algorithms breakdown when closing in on the correct value. I'll also need to install some form of exception hjandling in the future.
